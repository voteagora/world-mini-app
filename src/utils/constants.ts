		description:
			`The World Foundation, established in 2022 to create a fairer governance and digital economy, stewards the World Network towards self-sustainability.

To foster community engagement and hold itself accountable, the Foundation proposes a set of community values for ratification. This commitment ensures the Foundation will collaboratively evolve these principles with the community as it progresses towards a **decentralized**, **privacy**\-preserving **proof-of-human** system for the World. 

The World Foundation’s set of values and how we interact with the community is intricately tied to World’s project mission; to create a globally-inclusive identity and financial network \[1\]. 

Thereby, we set forth the following core community values that we aim to uphold and foster including:

**Privacy:** We believe in protecting the community’s right to preserve their privacy and digital identity. Our obsession with privacy is the bedrock upon which the World Network is built on and reflected in our team's efforts and ethos. Privacy is not an afterthought but by design. [World ID](https://world.org/world-id) is an example of our efforts in building privacy-preserving proof of human technology, with the Orb designed for maximum privacy. The Foundation acts as the "data controller" for personal data collected via Orb sign-ups after network launch \[2\].

**Decentralization:** Whilst World Network pioneers decentralization of the World infrastructure through an open-source protocol and empowering local communities to develop their own World ecosystem under a shared IP. This proposal is the mark of the World Foundation’s dedication to experimenting with methods towards community governance \[3\] (as part of our shared decentralization roadmap) by allowing World ID *Orb-verified* users to express a 1 person 1 vote mechanism on all proposals presented in this app.  

**Proof-of-Human Integrity:** We believe to restore trust in the age of AI, there is a fundamental human need to be recognized as human, maintain control over one’s digital identity and safety online. With World Network, the Foundation is laying the grounds for a highly secure and inclusive proof-of-human (POH) mechanism \[4\] to address challenges posed by AI. This is seen as essential for enabling authentic human connection and restoring trust in digital spaces

**Community engagement:** The Foundation is dedicated to fostering the growth and education of its consumers, World mini app developers, and community advocates. Our responsibilities include facilitating community activations and discussions, and providing opportunities for contribution. To date, the Foundation has actively supported community development through [ecosystem grants](https://world.org/grants). Our long-term goal is to expand our community reach, creating a space for dialogue and engagement.

*We seek your support for this ratification proposal, which aims to establish a foundational and mutually recognized set of community values to guide our work and ensure accountability.*
