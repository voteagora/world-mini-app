# dao-client

The DAO client implementation provides core functionality for interacting with DAO node data, focusing on proposal and voter information management.

### Core Data Fetching and Caching
`src/lib/dao-node/client.ts`:

1. Proposal Data Management:
- Fetches and caches all proposals via `getAllProposalsFromDaoNode`
- Filters out canceled proposals automatically
- Maintains proposal type information through `getProposalTypesFromDaoNode`
- Individual proposal retrieval with `getProposalFromDaoNode`

2. Vote Data Processing:
- Retrieves delegate voting history with `getVotesForDelegateFromDaoNode`
- Fetches proposal-specific votes using `getVotesForProposalFromDaoNode`
- Transforms raw vote data through `formatVoteHistoryItem` for user display

### Vote Transaction Handling
`src/components/VoteDrawerContent.tsx`:

1. Multi-step Vote Processing:
- Manages vote selection and reason collection in separate steps
- Constructs vote parameters based on proposal type (standard/approval)
- Integrates with World ID verification
- Handles transaction submission and receipt monitoring

2. Vote Parameter Construction:
- Encodes ABI parameters for on-chain transactions
- Validates voting options against proposal constraints
- Manages World ID proof inclusion in vote data

### Domain-Specific Data Transformations

1. Vote History Formatting:
- Converts raw vote data into standardized display format
- Includes proposal name, support type, timestamp
- Calculates vote percentages for display

2. Proposal Status Determination:
- Evaluates proposal state based on voting module
- Checks participation thresholds and block numbers
- Determines final status (active/succeeded/failed/executed)

Importance Scores:
- Proposal Data Management: 95 (Core DAO functionality)
- Vote Transaction Handling: 90 (Critical voting mechanics)  
- Vote History Processing: 85 (Key integration point)
- Status Determination: 80 (Important workflow)
