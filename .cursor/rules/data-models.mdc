### Core Data Models

#### Proposal Model
```typescript
type Proposal = {
  id: string;
  status: ProposalStatus; 
  type: 'standard' | 'approval';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  votes: VoteData;
  thresholds: {
    participation: number;
    approval: number;
  }
}
```

#### Vote Data Model
```typescript
type VoteData = {
  support: boolean;
  parameters?: string[];
  worldIdProof: {
    root: string;
    nullifierHash: string;
    proof: string[];
  }
}
```

#### User Preferences Model
```typescript
type UserPreferences = {
  address: string;
  notifications: {
    proposals: boolean;
    votes: boolean;
    results: boolean;
  }
}
```

### Data Relationships

1. Proposals to Votes (One-to-Many)
- Each proposal contains multiple vote records
- Votes reference proposal ID and store World ID verification data
- Vote parameters vary based on proposal type (standard/approval)

2. Users to Preferences (One-to-One)
- User preferences linked by wallet address
- Notification settings stored per user
- Cached locally with server sync

### Data Transformations

1. Proposal Status Determination
- Evaluates current state, voting module, thresholds
- Calculates participation and approval percentages
- Determines final status (active/succeeded/failed/executed)

2. Vote History Formatting
```typescript
formatVoteHistoryItem({
  proposalName: string,
  support: boolean,
  date: string,
  percentage: number
})
```

3. Proposal Description Processing
- Markdown parsing for proposal descriptions
- Vote percentage calculations
- Support type formatting for display
