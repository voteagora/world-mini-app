### Core Voting Flow
`src/components/VoteDrawerContent.tsx`
- Multi-step voting process with initial vote selection followed by reason submission
- World ID integration for human verification before vote submission
- Vote parameter construction combining selected options and World ID proof
- Transaction submission with encoded ABI parameters
Importance: 95

### Proposal Status Algorithm
`src/lib/utils.ts`
- Determines proposal states: active, succeeded, failed, executed, pending, canceled
- Evaluates minimum participation thresholds and vote requirements
- Calculates current status based on block numbers and participation metrics
Importance: 90

### Vote Option Selection
`src/components/CastVote/Options.tsx`
- Handles single vs multiple option selection based on proposal type
- Enforces maximum selection limits for approval voting
- Maintains selected options state and validates against max allowed selections
Importance: 85

### Vote Parameter Construction
`src/components/VoteDrawerContent.tsx`
- Assembles vote transaction parameters:
  - World ID verification proof (root, nullifierHash, proof)
  - Selected voting options
  - Vote reason/rationale
- Encodes parameters according to contract ABI format
Importance: 80

### Vote Transaction Processing
- On-chain submission of encoded vote parameters
- World ID proof verification within smart contract
- Vote counting and threshold calculation
- Vote state updates based on participation metrics
Importance: 75
