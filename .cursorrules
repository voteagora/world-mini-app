## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Logic Organization

### Governance and Voting System
- **World ID Integration**: Implements proof of humanity verification for governance participation through the VoteDrawerContent component
- **Vote Processing Pipeline**: 
  - Parameter construction and encoding for on-chain submission
  - World ID proof verification
  - Transaction submission to governance contracts
  - Vote status tracking and feedback

### Delegate Management
- Tracks delegate voting history and participation metrics
- Manages proposal relationships and voting power distribution
- Handles delegate status updates and notifications

### Proposal Lifecycle Management
- Status determination based on voting thresholds and participation metrics
- Support calculation for standard and approval-based voting
- Proposal type-specific parameter handling and validation

### Authentication and Authorization
- Custom wallet-based authentication flow with nonce generation
- Session management with wallet-specific user information
- Integration with NextAuth.js for protected routes

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Proposal and voter data transformation from DAO Node
- Vote history formatting with support types and percentages
- Notification preference management through external API
